What maccy does for you :
1) Unlike all other MAc changers Maccy does it interactively for you and let you make decisions.
2) Maccy at the first start scrapes a webiste which contains 20000 OUI (first 3 couples e.g. ( 11:22:33 ) MAC address real manifacturers) and archive them in your computer to use later.
3) It prompts you with all the available net interfaces in your system so you can choose which one you want to change the MAC.
4) After you can choose to generate a REAL MAC address using the database or input one by yourself
5) Finally it changes the MAC.
6) Well coomented code

Soon i'll add some more features, a bit of refactoring too, let me know if you enjoy it I don't think is bad for 6 hrs of work :P...

  PEACE N0PN0PN0P
